## 🚗 Used Car Price Prediction

### 📌 Overview

The used car market in India is growing rapidly, surpassing new car sales in recent years. Unlike new cars, pricing used cars is highly uncertain due to multiple factors like brand, model, mileage, fuel type, and ownership history. Predicting the right price is crucial for sellers, buyers, and businesses to make informed decisions.

This project builds a machine learning model to predict the price of used cars, helping businesses and individuals determine fair market value.
